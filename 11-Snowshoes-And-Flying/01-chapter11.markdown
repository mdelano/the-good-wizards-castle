#Chapter 11#
##Snowshoes and Flying!##

Oscar was so happy that Jay and the others from the orphanage were coming to visit the castle that he began to make preparations right away. Oscar never thought of himself as lonely at the castle. He had all the animals and the beauty all around him. Sometimes he even felt the presence of the wizard. Still, once he met Jay things changed and he wanted to have others enjoy the castle, too.

The visit on Christmas Eve day was so soon. Besides Jay’s visit starting on Christmas Eve, there would be ten children from the orphanage on Christmas Day. The first thing Oscar did was to tell all the animals in the castle that there would be wonderful visitors to the castle for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Then he even went out to the edge of the woods and shouted out to the animals in the woods! “Hello, hello! Seasons Greetings! I want you to know that Jay is coming for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The children from the orphanage are coming too on Christmas Day! Won’t that be wonderful? It feels like magic!”

A couple of Hoot Hoots rang from the woods. “Hoot, hoot back to you,” called Oscar. As he looked up two deer ran by and stopped at a nearby tree to rub their antlers and make them shine! Then they ran on flicking their white tails. They must be excited too.

What to do, next, thought Oscar. He decided that he would buy each child, including Jay, a pair of skates and a sled. That way they could all going skating and sledding on Christmas Day. He also wanted to buy Jay a pair of snowshoes so that he could go in the woods with Oscar, an electric train they had seen in a toy store in town and many books—some that had been Oscar’s favorites when he was a child.

“Oh my, oh my. I am so excited," Oscar said softly. He was a bit of a quiet and shy man, so expressing his excitement was a different thing for him. “I am so happy that Jay will be sharing Christmas Eve and Christmas with all of the animals and me. He is bringing all kinds of changes into my life. I am even letting my excitement show. How nice that is. I so want all of the children to have a wonderful Christmas day,” he said rubbing his hair as he did when he was excited.

Early on Christmas Eve Day, Oscar went to the orphanage to pick up Jay. Of course the dogs went with him and stayed in the back seat of the truck while Oscar went inside to get him. While they waited Merlin said to Snowy, “I have a plan. What do you think of it? I am going to take Jay flying again.” Snowy’s eyes got wide and she started to yelp and wag her tail. “I am not sure

that I want to tell Oscar about the flying, yet. I am afraid he will worry too much,” said Merlin looking very serious.

“He may be suspicious already,” said Snowy wisely.

“Hmm. You are very smart, my dear Snowy. Thanks for being my friend and confidant. I think Jay will keep it a secret. We love him and he loves us,” said Merlin. The dogs put their paws on top of each other’s paws and decided it was a plan. They would have to go out in the woods very near the castle way before it was dark so that they could go safely into the sky. They would only fly a few feet, but that would be enough.

Jay had been standing outside on the porch with Sister Marian excitedly waiting to catch a glimpse of Oscar’s truck. When Jay saw it he started jumping up and down, up and down. His hair seemed to stick out in the static of the air.

When Oscar and Jay got into the truck to the truck, Snowy and Merlin t jumped for joy and began to yelp. Then they each licked every inch of Jay’s face and wagged and wagged their tails. Once Oscar got the red truck started, Snowy stuck her head out one window and Merlin stuck his head out the other one and off they went.

Once they arrived at the castle Jay jumped from the truck and hauled out his suitcase. Then he ran inside and ran over to pat all three cats. “Hello Amelia Bright, Silver and Sky, the watcher. I am so happy to see you.” Sky rubbed on Jay’s legs and purrrrred so loudly you could probably hear it in town. Then Jay saw Beloved Feather and said, “Hello owl, I am so glad to see you, too. You are so beautiful and you are looking better and better!” The owl blinked back with his yellow eyes.

Oscar helped Jay take his bag up into the yellow bedroom so that he could get settled. Then they headed downstairs, Oscar lit the fireplace and turned on the Christmas tree lights and turned on some Christmas music.

Jay just stared and stared. He thought that the tree was so beautiful. Then Oscar had Jay unwrap an early Christmas present. Once he did, Jay didn’t know what to say because he didn’t know what the present was. Oscar explained that it was a pair of snowshoes so that the two of them could go into the woods, even when the snow was deep. He explained that he already had snowshoes and that snowshoes made it much easier to walk in the snow.

Jay couldn’t wait to try the snowshoes so off they went outside, hats and

mittens and scarves all adjusted against the cold. Oscar helped Jay put on the snowshoes. Jay tried to walk and immediately he fell over. He laughed and laughed. Oscar helped him get up. Oscar showed him how to walk in the shoes and after a few tries Jay got the idea and thought it was great fun.

As soon as Jay seemed comfortable using the snowshoes, off he and Oscar went in the woods, Crunchhh, crunch the sound of the snowshoes cut through the silence. Snowy and Merlin were close behind. The trees were covered with just a dusting of snow and the sun was bright. Some of the snow was melting off the trees making the air sparkle. It was a perfect day.

Every once in a while as Jay and Oscar walked along they would be unable to pick up one of their snowshoes. Sure enough they would look behind and who would be standing on top of the shoe but either Snowy or Merlin. Oscar and Jay both thought the dogs were doing it on purpose to make Jay and Oscar laugh and laugh they did.

Finally, Oscar said they should go back to the castle and have a late lunch. As soon as lunch was over, Oscar asked Jay if he would like to play outside for a while with the dogs. He told him to stay right around the castle. Jay said he most certainly would. He never wanted to be lost in the woods. Still he wondered if up in the air meant staying near the castle. He thought for a minute and decided that it did!!!

Jay began to make a snowman with the biggest snowballs he could lift. I hope Merlin will take me flying with him today, Jay thought. The dogs tumbled and romped and yelped. Jay began to make a small snowman. Suddenly Merlin came over and nudged Jay. Then Snowy did the same thing. The two of them started down the path—just barely out of sight of the castle. Then the dogs stood on either side of Jay and up, up and away they went.

Jay hit the edges of a few branches and the snow that was gathered on them fell onto his snowsuit. “I fffeel as though I could be a bird,” Jay mumbled, stammering just a little in his excitement. “I wish we could touch the sky and the white fluffy clouds. We are high enough so that I can even see the beach in the distance. Somehow it makes me think of the hollow music that I heard.” Merlin and Snowy looked at each other. So Jay had heard the music, too. “It must have had to do with the wizard," Merlin said to Snowy. "That’s what I have always thought.” Then down, down, as they landed as softly as a feather. It was the perfect thing to have happen on the Christmas Eve Day. "Yahoo he said to the dogs who barked back in return—and, of course, Merlin gave a huge howl.
