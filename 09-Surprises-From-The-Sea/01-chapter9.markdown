Everyone was still waiting for Christmas to come. Sometimes it just it just seemed to take forever. Snowy and Merlin were no exception. They couldn’t wait to see Jay and how happy he would be with this special Christmas. It was a beautiful day. The sky was bright blue with just a few fluffy white clouds that blocked out bits of the sun. There was no falling snow.

Oscar was working on some medical reading after he had first worked with the owl to help him strengthen his wing. When the owl did his exercises Oscar and he would go to the castle's back workroom. The owl had become so calm around Oscar that he would sit on Oscar’s shoulder and he would walk him there. Then Oscar would put the owl on a high bench and he would fly the short distance to where Oscar stood and land on his shoulder. It was so exciting to watch, especially since the owl seemed to be gaining strength even faster than Oscar had hoped. Often Snowy and Merlin would watch happily but today all they could think of was playing outside. It was such a brisk and clear day—too nice to be inside. They let themselves out the dog door that Oscar had installed for them.

This was Merlin’s first winter ever and how he loved to be outside playing with Snowy. His tail was wagging and wagging. Snowy’s tail was wagging back in response. They were jumping over each other like big white frogs and then rolling and rolling over and over in the snow, making happy rumbling sounds. After a while they decided to run down to one of the small beaches that was on the edge of the castle woods. Even in the winter the beaches were beautiful.

This particular beach was a special one because it had a monolith right near it in the woods. Snowy had explained to Merlin that a monolith was a large stone. It had been studied and archeologists were sure that it had come from the Vikings who had landed on this part of the peninsula, on one of the beaches that was on the castle lands. There was some possibility that scrapings on the stones were related to runic language which was supposed to hold magic. Merlin had looked at Snowy with wonder. He said, “That certainly fits with all of the magic that is around the castle!”

“Well," said Snowy, "many say that the wizard knew these people and may have gotten some of his magic from them. Sometimes when I am here I can just close my eyes and picture them. Sometimes I feel their presence as though they were still floating about in the skies above this beach.”

The blue water sparkled with diamonds where the sun hit the crests of ripples. They both ran in and got their feet wet and then decided it was way too cold for that! As they stood together they heard happy yelps. Down from the woods to the beach came a dog and a puppy. They couldn’t believe it, but the

dogs looked almost exactly like Snowy and Merlin. Snowy looked at Merlin and Merlin looked back. How wonderful this was — playmates for the two of them! The second dog that seemed to be a puppy looked to be about Merlin’s age. He still had his young puppy fur and a young puppy bark. His fur was a mottled color with brown and white and gray with a sort of dark gray dots. When he got closer they could see that his eyes were an ice, ice blue, almost like the cold, cold ocean. When he saw them he started to lift his feet as though he was dancing. He looked as though he was doing a puppy jitterbug.

Merlin and Snowy ran over to them and began to rub noses. They showed them how they played leapfrog. The big dog sat down with his shoulders thrown back and his black nose pointed up. He yelped with joy. The puppy sat down and stared with those ice blue eyes. He looked as though he, as Sky, was a watcher. He never moved; just sat and stared.

As they all looked at each other, there was suddenly a motion from the sea as it lapped at the beach. Every dog stopped and stared. From many yards out in the sea, where it would be well over the dogs’ heads, came a figure. He had silver armor covering his chest and high boots on that, so it seemed, would make it hard for him to walk in the water. Not so. He walked along with great strength not appearing to be deterred, never glancing at the dogs at all. The water seemed to fly apart as he walked through, sending sun sparks of rainbow light everywhere. The dogs didn’t know what to do so they continued to stare as he made his way out of the water.

He was so very tall, much taller than Oscar who was a very tall man. When he reached shore he walked very slowly to the monolith. The dogs noticed that he was carrying a thin stone that seemed to have writing on it. He placed the stone against the monolith and stared at it for a moment. Then he turned and ever so slowly walked, step by step, back into the sea. The sun shone even more brightly as it bounced off of his wet armor. He pulled a very, very large horn from the sea and blew it with one huge breath of air. The sound was beautifully loud and very hollow. It was as though magic were filling the air. As the hollow sounds spread out, drifted away and became softer and softer, he walked on until he was, once again, totally covered by the sea.

Snowy, Merlin and the new dog and puppy just stared and stared at the spot in the sea where the man had disappeared. The water was still moving about in that spot, as water does when it is disturbed. The sun still shone and, after the blast of the horn, everything seemed very, very quiet. The puppy seemed a little frightened. He looked at the other dogs and yelped a few times. Then he began to run slowly in the direction of the woods that would lead him away from the castle. The new dog quickly followed. Every once in a while they would turn back and seem to beckon the other dogs to follow. Snowy and Merlin glanced at each other, and then follow they did. They didn’t want to lose track of their new friends that was for sure.

After the puppy and dog ran a little way, they turned into a short dirt driveway to a stone cottage. On the porch of the cottage was a woman who looked very beautiful to Snowy and Merlin. She had been clapping her hands and calling, “Spirit, Spirit and Dickon, where are you??“ When she saw the two of them, she reached down and hugged them both and said, “I thought you might be lost. Oh, I love you my Spirit and Dickon. Don’t worry your Rose like that!”

She looked up and noticed the other two dogs, dogs that, except for being bigger, looked almost exactly like Spirit. “Oh, hello to you, too," she said to the dogs. You must be a Samoyed too, and your little friend, well I am not sure what you are. How wonderful this is. I think you must live close by. Maybe you all will be friends and my Spirit and Dickon will be able to have friends to play with! This is just lovely!”

Rose invited the dogs in and gave them all some water and some dog biscuits. They all licked each other and Snowy and Merlin set off again for the castle. Spirit and Dickon stayed behind. They looked up at her and Spirit seemed to give one of his Samoyed smiles, while Dickon just stared at her with his very blue eyes. “You must be so happy to have some friends," she said. "They must live on the other side of the woods where the castle is. I bet they will come back really soon to play with you. For now, let’s go in and get supper started. By the way, did you hear that huge horn sound, my Spirit and Dickon? I have never heard anything like it. It was like magic.”

Spirit and Dickon looked at each other and then they looked at her and wagged their tails furiously. Spirit gave her a smile, as Samoyeds so often do. He hoped Rose knew that they understood what she meant. It was a secret they shared with their new friends. Spirit hoped that they all could show Rose and the owner of the other dogs what the strange man had brought and placed beside the very large stone. He was sure that if they took Rose for a walk that she would see it also.

While Rose and Spirit began to make supper, Oscar and the animals at the castle were doing the same. Oscar said to the dogs, “Did you hear a strange, very loud horn sound coming from the woods? It was like magic.” They wagged their tails as fast as they could and gave him a Samoyed smile. They knew that they would take Oscar there very soon and they couldn’t wait. He would see the new stone and they were sure he would notice and would know what it was. Christmas time was bringing wonderful surprises to the castle!

That same afternoon Jay was working on his homework at the orphanage. He too heard the sound of a hollow note as though a very large horn was being blown. He looked around the study where he sat with the other children but no one else seemed to hear the magical musical sound. As he glanced out the window, he thought he saw a boney hand and then a face that quickly looked in at Jay and just as quickly was gone.

The wizard must have had something to do with this wonderfully musical sound, thought Jay. I wonder if this is part of the castle history? I just must talk to the wizard some more. Jay completely forgot about his homework and stared out the window. Sure enough, Jay realized, he was right for a sparkle of fire appeared in the window—just for a tiny bit of a second.
