#Chapter 4#
##Silver's Discovery##

On the day Snowy showed Merlin around the castle and Merlin shared his intuition, Jay was waiting impatiently at the orphanage. As soon as the children in the orphanage were allowed to go out and play, Jay headed for the edge of the woods. He couldn’t wait to get back to view the castle. There was even more snow in the woods then there had been before. It wasn’t very cold, though, and the sun was shining through the holes in the trees. He pulled off his woolen hat; his red hair fell around his bright blue eyes. Sometimes the kids teased him about the color of his hair but he just laughed. They would stop if he didn’t let them upset him and he never did. That just wasn’t his way. He liked most of the kids and even though he was quiet, he got along with all of them. He loved to read and was a good reader. Often he would read to the younger kids or to others who didn’t like to read as much as he did. This made him feel happy. His favorite book was King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He was thinking about that book as he walked through the woods as quietly as he possibly could.

As he came closer to the castle he could see that the old castle cat was walking towards something that was in the snow under the window. Jay had noticed in the past that the old cat rarely strayed too far from the castle but always stayed on the castle paths. Today he watched Mr. Silver as he walked around the castle on the paths that Oscar kept shoveled. The paths extended all around the edges of the castle so that Silver was able to take a very long walk.

Silver was about to head back inside for a snack when, all of a sudden, he noticed something unusual on the edge of the garden under one of the castle’s large windows. At first he backed up for he was a little bit frightened (though Silver hated to admit such things). However, as you know, cats are vey curious and Silver’s curiosity got the better of him. Slowly, ever so slowly, he snuck over to see what this strange thing was. “SHHH,” he said to himself as he tried to move each foot without making a sound. Moving one foot then pausing and moving the other…As Silver got closer, he saw that, sure enough, there was something unusual by the garden, half –covered with snow. He stopped suddenly, not sure what to do…..

As Silver crept forward paw by hesitant paw, he began to see what was in the snow. At first all he could make out were a few feathers, then a huge wing came into view. Finally, he realized it was an owl whose wing had been broken and who lay helplessly in the snow. Silver was old and so he had seen this owl before. He knew that he was one of the owls who was the head of the owl community—a very important owl, indeed. In fact, Silver thought that he might be the head of all the owls. He was so beautiful, but he really looked as though he was hurt, very hurt.

Silver knew that he had to find Oscar and let him know where the owl was but he didn’t know how to make Oscar understand. How could he, a cat, get Oscar to understand the owl was at the castle and needed help? Silver ran as quickly as he could to the castle barn. That was where Oscar often went. Sure enough Oscar was there and Silver stood in front of him and meowed the LOUDEST meows he possibly could.

"What is wrong?" asked Oscar who always took the animals seriously.

"Meow, Meow, Meow," cried Silver and then turned and stared walking toward the owl. Luckily, Oscar followed. When Oscar saw the owl under the window, he gasped. The owl was so beautiful! Immediately he could see that his wing was broken.

"Oh, my dear owl," he said. "You must be so frightened. I am a doctor and I know how to heal animals as well as people and I am quite sure we can fix that wing." The owl was panting he was so frightened.

"Trust me, trust me" said Oscar in a kind and gentle voice. "I will have to move you into the castle. I will put a board under you so that we don't hurt the wing. "

He ran to the barn and got a board. He went back to the bird and slid it under him. "Trust me, trust me," he repeated and the owl blinked his eyes at Oscar.

"You know," said Oscar, after the owl was safely on the board, "you are so very beautiful. I think you may be the head of the parliament of owls that live in the woods." The owl blinked over and over again. "Oh, the owls must be so worried about you, Mr. Owl.”

Oscar took the owl to his workroom in the castle. Here he kept his medical supplies. He tended to the owl's wing so that it could heal correctly.

"Your are lucky, Mr. Owl, for this break will mend quite easily. We will just have to keep you still for a while and then once your wing mends we will try some exercises to get you strong enough to go back to the woods and your woods owls."

Oscar placed the owl on the sill of the stained glass window in the room with the huge stone fireplace. "Now you will be warm and safe and you can look out the window at your woods. I think I will call you Feather."

Oscar lit the fire in the fireplace so that the owl and the other animals would be warm for the evening. Snowy and Merlin had lain down on the rug and Silver was preening and cleaning and looking very proud. Amelia Bright was curled up asleep by the fire. Sky, the watcher, was sitting by the fireplace watching and watching the owl.
