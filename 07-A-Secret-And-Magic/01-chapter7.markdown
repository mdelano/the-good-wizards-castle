#Chapter 7#
##A Secret And Magic##

In a flurry of snow from the huge Christmas tree, yelping dogs, ringing bells the entourage arrived at the door of the castle. In the window next to the door sat the owl. His eyes were blinking when he saw them all. Sky sat next to him and he was also blinking his eyes. Not only was the tree very large but also there was a stranger amidst the group. He was a little boy with red hair. To Sky he looked excited and a little afraid. Since Sky was often afraid of new things he felt a little sad for the boy. He knew he would feel fine once he came into the castle.

In they came dragging the snow and cold with them. The dogs were still excitedly bouncing about and Jay just stood very still. “Take off your jacket and hat, Jay. You and I need to warm up. Ok Snowy and Merlin, you need to calm down. You must be very tired, too, after pulling that tree all the way. Hello Sky, hello Mr. Owl. We won’t bother you. We just need to get something hot to drink and some water for the dogs. Then we can sit by the fire to warm up.”

“Do you like hot chocolate?" asked Oscar.

“It is the best!” replied Jay.

“Great. I will go make some. You sit here with the dogs and warm up. You should probably stay away from the owl. He is hurt and he might be afraid if you go too close.”

Jay said he would keep a distance and continued staring at the owl. “Hello owl," he said in a very quiet and soothing voice. "I am sorry you are hurt. You must be a little frightened. I am a little frightened too. I have never been here and I don’t want to do anything wrong. We might be friends because we would both understand being afraid. Still it is such a wonderful place and Oscar and the animals all seem to be kind and caring. I think we will be safe, do you?”

The owl blinked his huge eyes twice. He made two small hoots. The sound surprised both Jay and Sky who jumped away from the owl. “Those are friendly hoots," said Oscar as he brought the hot chocolate into the room. "If the owl were upset or angry he would have hissed. He must feel safe here and he must like you! I think you should keep talking to him. We don’t know what animals understand. You may be making him feel much better.”

Oscar and Jay sipped the hot chocolate carefully. Jay was starting to feel more relaxed. Oscar seemed so nice and so kind.

“I think you had better get back to the orphanage before they start to worry. We must make a plan. If you want, you could come back and help us all decorate the tree. Would you like that? “

“Oh, oh, oh," said Jay. "I wwould just love that. Ccould I really come back?”

“It would be so much fun. You have to come, right Snowy and Merlin?” The dogs wagged their tails furiously and came and rubbed against Jay’s legs.

“Why don’t you ask the nuns and I will give them a call this evening and see if you can come very soon. Maybe we can decorate it next Saturday when you won’t have school and there will be more time. “

“Please, pplease," said Jay. "I would like that so much. It would be the best thing I could think of to do. I should go right away before it starts to get dark. Thank you Mr. Olden for letting me help you with the tree and for the hot chocolate. It was all so wonderful. I can’t believe it really happened. This was like magic! “

He quickly put on his jacket and hat and went to the front door. Oscar asked him if he felt safe going home and he said he certainly did. He did it all the time- he knew the paths. Oscar told the dogs to go with Jay and off they went, Oscar watching until they were out of sight.

When Jay and the dogs were out of Oscar’s sight, Merlin nudged Snowy and then pointed his snout to Jay. Snowy knew exactly what he meant. They would fly Jay back to the orphanage so that he would know their secret! They each got on one side of Jay. Merlin took a giant leap and they all were flying just above the ground. Jay swallowed hard and looked at Merlin and Snowy. They both barked at him and wagged their tails.

“I am flying, I am flying,” shouted Jay into the wind. “I’m like Peter Pan!” The wind blew by and he took a huge gulp of air. Coughing a little, he managed to say, “Jimminy, Popsicle, Yahoo!” Merlin winked at Snowy and she winked back

This is more awesome magic, Jay thought to himself. Merlin can fly and Snowy knows how to go with him. Now I know, too. And I know their secret. WOwza DOwza!!!! The trees are going by and they are soft when they rub against me. We will be back through the woods in no time! This is more fun than almost anything I have ever done! They stayed in the path that was there. Whoosh, Jay heard as they passed tree after tree.

Then Merlin came to a stop by pressing his paws down in the snow. Snowy and Jay stopped, too, of course. Jay started to fall forward but they helped him stand. He was at the edge of the woods. It was just a short distance to the orphanage.

Jay hugged each dog and said, “I love you both. Thank you for the ride. I hope I can have another one soon! I hope I can come to see you at the castle very, very soon. I just can’t wait. I just can’t wait. “

The dogs barked and watched to see that Jay got safely out of the woods. They turned about to head back to the castle.

“Fly or run?” said Merlin.

“Run, said Snowy. We should save flying for special times. It is a special magic power you have and you should take care of it and only use it when you need to. I know why you did it today! You wanted Jay to know a secret and let him have some fun. He seems kind of sad. Am I right?”

“ You are right, said Merlin. You are almost always right, Snowy. You are the best friend anyone could have. Thank you.” Snowy just wagged her tail.

When Jay got back to the orphanage he told the nuns what had happened (well not the part about flying! That was his secret with the dogs.) They were a little worried that Jay had gone so far into the woods but they knew all about Oscar and what a good and kind man he was. So in a way, they were also happy that Jay was able to meet him and his animals and go to the castle. They knew Jay and they knew he would be well mannered. They needn’t worry about that. They told him that they looked forward to Oscar Olden’s phone call.

Oscar called early that evening. He told the nuns how polite and nice Jay was. He asked them if Jay could come that weekend to help decorate the tree. He said he could pick him up in his truck and bring him to the castle if that was OK with the nuns. The nuns said that would be wonderful for Jay and that they looked forward to actually meeting Mr. Olden.
