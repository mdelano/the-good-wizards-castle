##The Tree Trimming##
###Wishes, Whispers, and Wonders###

Saturday was a clear and cold day with just a few tiny squalls of snow. Oscar started out quite early in the morning to pick Jay up.

Oscar took his shiny red truck. The dogs had their heads out the back windows. They both loved to take a ride and have the air whistle by their faces. Oscar drove slowly but it took almost no time to arrive at the orphanage. There was Jay standing at the window watching. He threw on his coat and called to the nuns.

Oscar came to the door. It was promptly opened by the nuns and out popped Jay. The nuns shook Oscar’s hand and thanked him. The dogs both barked when they saw Jay and Merlin let out a huge howl!

Oscar felt a chill of excitement go through him as he started back towards the castle. How he loved Christmas time! Jay was sitting next to him in the front seat. The dogs had their heads stuck out the truck windows in the back seat. Their tongues were hanging out because they were panting in excitement.

As the truck got closer and closer to the castle, out of habit Jay looked at the tree where the wizard often sat. Sure enough, there he was. With a big smile on his face he gave a quick, furtive wave to Jay and then clicked his fingers. The usual sparks flew and he ducked behind the tree limbs.

Somehow Oscar felt this Christmas was going to be the most wonderful one he had ever had. He knew for sure that the tree they had chosen was the most beautiful tree he had ever had for Christmas.

The truck chugged into the castle driveway. Jay jumped out; Oscar jumped out; and the dogs jumped out. They all headed towards the tree that was still beside the door on the sled. “Oh, I knew I was right, “ said Jay jumping off the ground just a bit. “This is the most beautiful of trees. I can’t wait to see it standing in the beautiful castle. Will it go in the room where the owl is sitting?”

“Yes," said Oscar, brushing all of the snow off of the tree and getting it ready to bring into the house. Snowy was staring at it and pacing around in her excitement. It was Merlin’s very first Christmas tree ever. When he saw that Oscar was bringing it into the house he became very confused. A tree in the house, he thought?

“Come help me Jay, Oscar said with a chuckle. This tree is so large we are going to have trouble getting it through the castle door!”

Oscar opened the door. He and Jay put all of their strength together.

The sides of the tree stuck in the door for a few seconds. With a poof and a woom, in flew the huge tree and landed on the floor of the hallway. They pushed and pulled until they got it to the corner of the room. Then up, up and into the tree stand it went, upright and proud as any tree could be.

Sky had his eyes as wide open as possible and he didn’t move. The owl seemed to blink as though he liked the tree, so Sky started to feel better. The Christmas carol Jingle Bells was playing in the background. Amelia immediately ran to try to climb a couple of branches, but pine needles are prickly so she didn’t climb very far. Silver just stretched out and purred and eventually nodded off. Snowy and Merlin both tried to lie down under the tree; it was so large that they both fit easily.

It was not even noontime so there was plenty of time to trim the tree before it got dark.

Oscar hustled up to the castle attic and came down carrying boxes and boxes of lights and ornaments. He opened each box and looked inside to see what it held. Then he went into the kitchen to get the cranberries that he had been stringing for the last month. Amelia ran after him and tried to taste one of the cranberries. She always wanted to know what every bit of food tasted like. She hissed and looked away. “A bit too sour for your taste, Amelia?” asked Oscar. “Nothing like a nice bowl of fish,” she said to herself, cahuffling out of the kitchen.

Out from the many boxes came the decorations! First Oscar began to string the lights on the tree. The lights were beautiful and made in the shape of candles. That never seems to be an easy job and, for a few minutes he looked a little upset. “Ouch,” Oscar said sounding frustrated, “These branches are really prickly.” The dogs looked up in concern and Ms. Amelia put her paws over her eyes. But, as they always do, the lights somehow ended up on the tree. Oscar turned them on and stepped back looking satisfied and happy. “Oh, boy, they look awesome,” said Jay.

On went the strings of cranberries. Once again, Amelia put her paws over her eyes, but though they didn’t taste good, she had to admit they made the tree look even prettier. Jay couldn’t believe his eyes. “Oh, my gosh. Oh my gosh,” he kept repeating. “I have never seen a tree like this.”

“Next we have to hang the crystal balls,” said Oscar with a smile. “You do the lower branches and I will do the upper ones.” As they hung the crystal balls they caught the light from the tree and prisms of color flew out everywhere into the room.

Finally, Oscar hung the wizard ornament almost at the top of the tree

and at the very end (how could he forget?) he placed a beautiful golden star on the top of the towering tree. He thought of it as the North Star, just like the real North Star in the sky that hung above the castle. The star just fit beneath the ceiling.

Once the star was on, he lit the fireplace, walked across the room, followed by Jay, and viewed the finished product. Oh, it was just so beautiful with the silver balls reflecting the light and the star, ever so bright, at the top of the tree and, of course, with the wizard ever present, hanging right below the star. All the animals seemed to be smiling at the tree. All, that is, except Feather whose eyes blinked over and over in what seemed like wonder. There was magic everywhere as the tree stood in all its beauty. The wizard ornament seemed to gleam more brightly than everything else, even the lights.

Since the tree was done, Oscar made the hot chocolate that Jay liked so much and the two of them sipped away and admired the tree. “Do you know why there is a wizard ornament on the tree? “ Oscar asked Jay.

“Oh yyyes," replied Jay with his eyes glistening. "Ah, ah" he stammered a bit, "I have heard the stories about the wizard from people in town and the nuns." He rubbed his hand through his red hair when he said this. He wasn’t sure whether to tell Oscar more, but decided not to. “Have you ever seen or talked to the wizard?" Jay asked Oscar.

"Well sometimes I think I catch a glimpse of his hand or his hat in the trees, but when I look again I can never find him. I know he is out there. I can just feel it. I think he has always protected the castle and those in it as well as the woods around the castle. I think that he doesn’t want me to see him, though. My mother told me that she had seen him many times. Not my father though. I have never seen him. I hope I do some day. A few days ago I made a wish and sent it out to the wizard. I surely hope he heard me!", Oscar said putting his head in his hands just for a second. Jay just listened. Outside in a tree he caught a glimpse of a bright red hat.

Sooner than possible it was time for Jay to head back to the orphanage. Oscar and the dogs took him in the truck. He thanked and thanked Oscar for the wonderful day. Oscar said he must come again. The dogs kissed him goodbye and put their tails down when they realized he was gone.

Later that night when Jay was cozy in his bed, he thought about the day. It had been a wonderful day. He started to cry—very quietly so the others in the orphanage would not hear him. “I wish, I wish upon a star", he said. "I wish I could live in the castle with Oscar and the animals. I wish this would happen so much that it is making me cry. I don’t want anyone to see me cry, though. I have always known I wanted a family, but now I know that I want to be part of this

family! I am eight years old. I don’t know if I will ever know about my real family. I want to love and be loved. That is what makes a real family. The next time I see the wizard I am going to tell him my wish. I think he will help me. Then I am just going to believe as hard as I can!” Upset as he was, his eyes closed and he was asleep dreaming of flying with dogs.

That night when Oscar was lying in bed he thought about how joyful the day had been. Trimming the tree had always been an especially special and happy time, he thought, but this day was even more special with the new puppy, the owl, and Jay to be part of it all. "Oh, oh, now I know I was right when I said I would like to have a child around the castle. It seems to be so odd and lucky that Jay met us in the woods. Maybe the wizard heard me after all! Could it be possible that Jay is the child who should be with us and the wizard has now brought him to us?” He drifted off to sleep and thought of Christmas and giving Jay a Christmas present from himself and the animals. He had a wonderful sleep.

Outside the wizard was still sitting in the tree watching the castle. He saw Oscar’s light go out. Through the window he could see the owl asleep with Sky asleep next to him. And he could also see that the dogs that were still awake.

As the castle grew quiet and everyone else slept, Snowy and Merlin were lying under the Christmas tree. Snowy looked at Merlin and asked, “What is it like to have special powers?” Merlin said, “Well, I have never known anything different, so in some ways it is hard to say. I do know that I feel very blessed to have such powers. I do remember that when I was living with the wolves and the wizard told me that he had given me such powers, I must always remember that the powers could only be used for good. I promised with all my heart. When I promised the wizard looked at me and snapped his fingers. Sparks flew out as he said, “And so it is.” From then on I felt the powers. I had thought about it and realized that with any power comes responsibility. I am so glad that I have you as a very best friend so I can talk things over with you and share things about my powers. I also am so proud and grateful that I get to live in this castle with all the other animals and a man as kind as Oscar.”

Merlin whispered to Snowy, “Come stand by the Christmas tree with me and be very quiet and very still.” Looking very curious, she did just that. Then Merlin said, “Take hold of my paw and hold very tightly. “ Suddenly, whooossshhh, they were both suspended in the air at the same height as the star on the Christmas tree. “Wish for peace on earth,"Merlin said to Snowy and she did. The wizard ornament gleamed so brightly that it hurt Snowy’s eyes. Just at that second Feather woke up, opened his large eyes and stared at the two dogs. He seemed to wink with one eye. This was just the beginning of what they would see of Merlin’s magic, he knew. Then the dogs drifted quietly back down to go to sleep beneath the tree. Thinking of peace on earth, Feather drifted quietly off to

sleep. Oddly enough, Sky, Amelia and Silver never awoke. The tree just stood in its splendor and the wizard ornament gleamed on with special brightness.
