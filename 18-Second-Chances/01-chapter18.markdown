#Chapter 18#
##Second Chances##
###I Wish, I Believe, I Love###

Life is full of second chances. That is one of the wonderful things about life. Even on the darkest of days there is lots of hope that the next day will be brighter. But you must believe.

GOSH. Things were just absolutely dark and bleak. No one seemed to be able to eat breakfast. Oscar spent the morning getting his papers together to take to the orphanage and trying to clear his head. Snowy and Merlin ran around outside but finally just came inside and stayed with Oscar. After a while, he took the dogs and all of his paper work and got into the truck to head for town. Usually Merlin and Snowy would stick their heads out of the truck windows and bark with glee, but not today. Today they just lay down in the back seat of the truck and looked at Oscar. Nothing Oscar could think of to say seemed to be the right thing.

On the way Oscar stopped by the castle mailbox. There was Jay’s letter. Oscar quickly tore open the envelope. Inside was Jay’s long thought out letter. In the end he had decided to simply say, “I love you and all the others at the castle. I hope I can come live in the castle.” It was signed, “Love Jay.”

As Oscar walked up the steps of the orphanage, his heart was sinking. He decided he just had to have faith, believe in miracles and do his very best. He rang the bell and the nuns came to greet him. They went into the parlor and sat down. He began to talk and talk, quite rapidly because he was sooo nervous.

Oscar took out the letter that Jay had sent him and handed it to the nuns. They didn’t say anything. After lots of further explanations, he told them that Merlin was coming in the night to stay with Jay and they were shocked. They kept picking up Jay’s letter and putting it down, picking it up and putting it down. After what seemed like forever, Sister Marian said that she thought that she and Sister Amadeus needed to talk more about this on their own and then with their superiors. They would be in touch with Oscar very soon.

Oscar finally went home. It was cold and it had started to get dark. He made himself dinner and fed the animals. He took one of his favorite books off the shelf. It was a history of the castle, including stories of the wizard. He began to think about the wizard and that helped a little.

Oscar felt very tired. He trudged up the stairs to his bedroom, one heavy step at a time, with the dogs at his heels. Sleep would not come. He tossed and turned and tossed and turned. From his bed he could look out at the woods. The moon was more than half full and the night was clear. “Oh, I wish that the wizard was outside in the trees watching the castle,” he said to the dogs. “I wish I wish

that the wizard could help me to find a way to adopt Jay. All of us could teach him things and he could teach us. He is good and loving and caring and it is right that he come and be with us at the castle. Oh wizard can you help?” he said looking out at the woods.

Suddenly Oscar saw a shower of sparks that looked as though it came from a tree. And then he thought he saw a smudge of black with a bit of gold. Just at that moment the moon went behind a cloud and he could see no more. “How I wish that was the wizard,” Oscar said feeling very sleepy. Merlin winked his eye and rolled over and went to sleep. Snowy was already asleep; she was dreaming of a man with very boney fingers and sparkles at his fingertips.
