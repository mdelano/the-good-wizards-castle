##Visitors to the Castle - Whoooo Hooooo##

After everyone else was asleep, Midnight Sky lay awake. He had gotten off of the chair and was on the rug by the fireplace. Fire still crackled in the fireplace. Midnight Sky loved the heat and he also liked the quiet.

Silent Midnight Sky was a watcher. He was very cautious about people and animals that he didn’t know. Tonight Sky was watching the owl. He wasn’t sure what he thought about such a large bird. The owl seemed to be sleeping soundly after having his wing bandaged.

Quietly, so as not to wake Miss Amelia, who always got into the middle of things, Sky walked over towards the window. Sky was like a gymnast. He could jump so very agilely with wonderful grace that impressed and surprised everyone. He always landed where he wanted to and never seemed to falter. Tonight he was trying to decide whether to jump up next to the owl. He was worried that the owl was not warm enough, since it is especially good to stay warm after an injury.

Suddenly, in one swift and gentle leap, Sky was beside the owl on the windowsill never touching, disturbing or waking Feather. Sky’s eyes were as wide as they could be. He had never been this close to an owl before. Sky looked at his beautiful feathers, wanting to touch them but not wanting to awaken or frighten the owl.

For quite a while Sky sat quietly watching, and watching and watching the owl. As he watched something caught his eye outside in a tree that was near the window. He looked again and there he saw a pair of huge oval yellow eyes, shiny and brighter than any eyes Sky had ever seen before. It was so dark in the tree that all the he could see were the eyes. Then he realized that he could see another pair of eyes, and another and another. Many pairs of huge yellow eyes were staring at the window. Suddenly, Sky understood what he was looking at. The eyes were the eyes of the castle woods owls.

He wasn’t sure he wanted to do this. “I must awaken the owl, but what if I do and he tries to hurt me? The owl has a huge beak! Maybe I should just do nothing. Oh, dear. No, I must be brave. I must help our visitor the owl and all of the other owls who must also be frightened without their friend and leader.” The yellow pairs of eyes just kept watching and watching. The tree looked like a tree hung with Christmas tree lights.

“Courage," he said to himself. "This is important and it must be done. You

must take a risk.” So very gingerly and slowly, ever so slowly, he reached his paw out (claws in of course) and touched Feather on his head. The owl slept on. Then he touched him again, and then once more. Feather stirred and opened first one yellow eye and then the other. He looked startled and a little afraid. After all, he had never seen Midnight Sky up close before and he was in a strange place and he was hurt. Sky stared back and tried to stay very still so that the owl would not be afraid. He didn’t know what to do next. “I am afraid," Sky said, his paws trembling. "The owl is different from me but I think I can trust him. I must. How am I going to let the owl know that he has visitors outside if I keep thinking about being afraid? I am just going to stick my wet nose upon the window and never move it until the owl, too, looks outside.” By the time his breath started to fog up the window, the owl looked.

As Feather looked out the window, he jumped a tiny bit and let out a huge sigh. The darkness of the night had been lit up by the owls many, many pairs of yellow eyes. “I cannot believe it. The whole parliament of castle woods owls must be in that tree. They have come looking for me,” said Feather with amazement. “How could they have found me? I know, I know," he stammered in his surprise. "The white wolves must have been watching over me. They watch out for all of us on behalf of the wizard.”

I must let them know I am all right. Feather blinked his own large yellow eyes three times so that they would know he had seen them. Three times, in the darkness, the tree full of eyes blinked back! He nodded his head ever so slightly, and ever so slightly, the owls nodded back. Then all the pairs of eyes moved up and away into the night like a blanket of stars as they left to go home. Now they knew that their Beloved Feather was safe in the castle.

Sky placed one of his paws on the tip of Feather’s hurt wing in order to let him know he had company and a guardian. Then he, too, fell asleep on the windowsill next to the owl and both of them slept a wonderful sleep. Feather fell asleep with the feel of Sky’s paw on his wing.
