###Chapter 1###
##Once Upon a Time in the Castle Woods##

AND…Once upon a time there was a boy named John James. Everyone called him Jay. Jay had strawberry blond hair that shone in the sunshine and turquoise blue eyes that became very bright when he was excited. He had no freckles—though people with red hair often do. Jay was a thoughtful and quiet boy of eight. He lived in an orphanage that was on the border of the castle woods. He loved being outside in nature and especially loved the woods and the ocean.

Jay also loved reading books and hearing stories. From reading he had taught himself about nature, how to watch the sun in order to understand direction and time and the names of many of the trees and birds and flowers that he saw when he walked in the woods near the orphanage. He also understood things about the night skies, for example how to find the North Star and some of the constellations such as the Big Dipper.

Sometimes when he was very excited or anxious, he would stammer just a bit. Often when he felt happy and joyful, or when he figured something out that had been bothering him, he would say, “ Oh, Oh, Oh, popsicle!” (He loved all flavors of popsicles.)

Now that Jay was eight years old he thought even more about the mystery of his past. One very important thing that Jay had not been able to figure out was why he was an orphan. He had lived in an orphanage since he was a newborn and was abandoned at the orphanage door. No one seemed to know who his parents were.

The story starts as Jay was walking through the woods near the orphanage. He was thinking about the beauty of the woods and about the castle that stood in the middle of the woods. As he walked along it occurred to him that he was spending much less time thinking about the mysteries of his past since he had become very interested in the castle. This was a good thing.

Jay had figured out that if he went into the woods that were on the border of the orphanage he could follow an overgrown, but still passable, path. After school each day he would sneak away from the orphanage while everyone was outside playing and half running and half skipping, he would follow it until he came to a place where he could see the castle.

Jay had been doing this for about six months so he had seen the castle from the spring to winter. Jay would stop at the place where he could watch the castle but not be seen (he was pretty sure). Jay knew from stories of the castle told by those who lived in town that a man named Oscar Olden who was a doctor owned it. He also knew that the castle had once belonged to the Wizard Myrddin who, it was commonly thought, still lived in the castle woods, though few claimed to ever have actually seen him. Jay loved watching the castle. Some days he dreamed about going inside and looking around. It was so beautiful.

The second thing that Jay had unexpectedly discovered on his walks in

the woods was the presence of a creature that would often appear in one tree or another along the path. When Jay first spotted the creature he was so frightened that he thought his hair might be standing on end. He knew that his teeth were chattering. Once they stopped chattering, the only thing that Jay could think of to say was, “Pppopsicle, ppopsicle!"

The creature looked older than anyone Jay had ever seen. He had long boney fingers. Actually his face looked boney, too. He seemed to be a little stooped over and his hair was thick and long and black. Once when Jay had gotten close enough to him to see the color of his eyes. They were like brown diamonds with sparks shooting out the way they had shot out from a diamond he had once seen in a museum. Jay knew, though he didn’t know how he knew, that this was the Wizard Myrddin. He was sure of it.

For a short while Jay continued to be afraid of Myrddin until he remembered some of the stories about him that he had heard. Many stories about the wizard were about the good he had done over time. One story reported that he had made the White Wolves who lived in the forest outside the castle lands gentle, kind, and peace-loving. It was said that they were still best friends with Myr (as he was commonly called) and they often helped him out with tasks of kindness and courage. So Jay decided that he must not be a mean wizard. He stopped being afraid and felt happy and safe when he saw Myrddin in a tree. For a long time the wizard never spoke to Jay but Jay started making a habit of waving to him. When he did the wizard would always snap his fingers and sparks would fly out that were as bright as the ones in Myr’s eyes. Then the wizard would wave back to Jay.

As far as Jay could tell, the wizard was just watching, watching over the castle and castle woods all the time from different places. He wondered why he could see the wizard and others never did. He hoped that some day the wizard would talk to him. He thought that just maybe, because the wizard was old, he could tell Jay about Jay’s family. He hoped and hoped and hoped.

Jay was bundled up in his snow jacket, snow pants and warm winter hat. He was very glad of that because it was very cold out and it had started to snow—big huge flakes of snow that looked like tufts of soft white clouds that had gotten confused and fallen from the sky. The days were getting shorter so he had to make his trips shorter in order to get back to the orphanage before dark.

Jay walked until he could see the castle from where he stood half-hiding behind a tree. As Jay watched the castle he could also faintly hear the yelping of what sounded like a puppy. Then suddenly he heard all the clocks in the castle begin to chime. He remembered from the stories of the castle that all the clocks chimed every night at twelve and that whenever the clocks chimed at times other than that it meant that something very important was going to happen. According to the stories, it was the wizard who had put a spell on the castle clocks. Jay looked back and found the wizard still watching. He gave jay a huge wink with his diamond eyes.

Jay did not know what was happening behind that magical -looking door. As he glanced up at the wizard again, he realized that he, too, was watching very, very intently. Jay could hear barking from inside the castle and, oh my, he thought he saw a little white fur ball of a puppy, jumping about in the snow in front of the door and could hear him yelping excitedly. Jay’s eyes widened as he gasped and whispered, “Popsicle, popsicle” as he watched the heavy castle door slowly creak open.
