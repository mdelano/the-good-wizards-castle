Around the castle the shadows of the trees were getting very long and the chill in the air was increasing. A while earlier it had started to snow. Snowy, the Samoyed had lived with Oscar for one year. He came to the castle when he was a two-month-old puppy. Oscar and Snowy were best friends and they were sitting together in front of the large stone fireplace. It was alight with a glowing warmth. Snowy seemed to be on guard, as though expecting that something would happen. Oscar was reading a medical journal. They were both a little sleepy from having been outside in the cold and then sitting in front of the warm fire.

The castle cats, Mr. Silver, Midnight Sky and Ms. Amelia Bright were all in the room too. The cats only liked the snow when it wasn’t very cold out. On this day they were all avoiding the outside. Mr. Silver because he was very old was lounging on the back of his favorite stuffed chair. Midnight Sky and Ms. Amelia Bright, since they were very young, were playing leapfrog with each other. When Amelia got bored she would switch and play another of her favorite games. She would burrow under a small rug and then situate herself so that only her face could be seen—big green eyes, surrounded by white and grey fur, would shine out. Midnight Sky wasn’t sure what to do when she did this so he just watched her.

“I just love the snow,” Oscar said to Snowy as they stood at the window near the front door. “I know that you do too. I am always in such a joyful mood when I see the snow. We will have to go out one more time to see the snow before it gets dark. Maybe we can even catch some on our tongues. It is snowing so hard now that I can hardly see anything. There is quite a bit of snow on the ground, already. I am so glad that I dusted all the cobwebs off the sleigh, and readied it. I put on its winter bells and shook out the heavy furry blankets.” Snowy wagged her tail furiously at Oscar.

Suddenly the sound of clocks chiming and owls singing hoots in return could be heard echoing inside the castle and in the woods. While staring out the window at the snow and listening to the clocks chime and the owls hoot, both Oscar and Snowy, at the very same time, saw something--a little ball of white fur with big brown eyes and black nose sitting in the snow just outside the castle door.

“Do you see what I see?” Oscar said to Snowy. “It looks like a ball of fluffy fur with black nose and eyes, big ears that pointed right to the sky and a plume of a tail that curls right over its back. It is a puppy, a puppy just like you!” Snowy started to jump up and down and yelp high-pitched yelps, which she only did when she was very, very excited.
