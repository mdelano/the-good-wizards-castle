#Chapter 15#
##The Wolves Put On a Show##

Jay was walking in the woods by the castle even more than usual since the holidays were over. It helped him to feel less lonely. The castle woods were close to the orphanage so it was easy for him to go there after school before it got dark. Being in the woods when it was dark was not something Jay wanted to do—besides all children had to be back at the orphanage before dark and it got dark so quickly in winter.

When Jay was in the woods he felt peaceful and happy. He thought a lot about what he knew and what he didn’t know about his background. He wished so much that the wizard had told him more. How could the wizard have known his mother? Did she have red hair, too? Did she have that funny wave in the front that made her hair fall over his face the way he did? What was she like? Was he from a kind family? Did the wizard like him? Was he like the wizard in any way? When would the wizard tell him, or would it always be a secret? “I wish I knew,” said Jay talking to the sky. Then he put his head in his hands, for just a second. Sometimes he felt so sad about not knowing. It was too cold to stop, he thought. He needed to keep walking.

Jay missed the castle. He would often think about how much he wished he could go and live at the castle. He wondered if he was a special enough person to live in the castle…Then he would think about the fact that each and every person was special and he would stop worrying about that. When he thought about all of this, he would stop and put his hands together and squeeze them tight and wish very hard that he could be with Oscar and the animals. Then he would always say, “I believe, I believe.” That’s what he did on this cold day, a day so cold he could see his breath and with a sky so blue it looked like the earth was turned upside down and it was a huge frozen pond hanging over his head. He squeezed his hands so hard while looking at the sky that he felt as though his red hair was standing on end.

Jay was getting so cold that he realized he ought to put on his hat and pull it down over his ears. He was starting to shiver a little. He was sure he was near Otter Pond. That was where he wanted to go. He liked to go there to think. He knew he would feel better once he got there, not so lonely.

As he started to look down at the snowy path to get his bearings, he saw a motion in the trees. Then whoosh, down came the wizard in one jump. “Hello, Mr. Wwwizard,” said Jay with just a slight stammer. “How nnice to see you!”

“Just call me Myr, Jay,” said the wizard, whose eyes looked like they were twinkling an especially bright blue. “I am happy to see you, too, though I see you

a lot when you don’t even know that I am there!”

“Oooh, Myr. I hope you are around me a lot. That makes me feel very happy and kind of safe, now that I think of it.”

“Well, now, and that you should feel safe,” said Myr. "I keep you and the wolves and Merlin safe all of the time but, of course, you have to do your part, too. And, speaking of the wolves, would you like to see what they are doing now at Otter Pond?"

“I was on my way to the pond, said Jay, and I would love to see the wolves… but Mr. Mmyrr, can you tell me more about my mother, too? I so want to know about her, and my father, and why you knew them and whether that means I might be like you in any way? Or did you only know my mother and not my father? How could that be? And who are the wolves?”

“The wolves are the white wolves from the hills that are near the castle woods. They have been here for as long as I have. They are kind wolves. Do you know why?”

“No,” said Jay, "I am sort of afffraid of wolves.”

“Well, you should be, except that these wolves are different. When I placed a spell over them, they became kind forever. Each generation will be kind. They watch from high up in the hills where they live. They protect the woods. That is their duty because of the spell. These white wolves are wonderful. They took care of Merlin when he was the tiniest puppy. When Merlin found the castle, their care was no longer needed. They still love him and take care of him by watching over him now that he lives in the castle. I think they will be part of your life just as they have been part of Merlin’s.”

“You have a lot of other questions, my young lad," said the wizard chuckling and speaking rapidly. "Now you know some about the wolves. You will have to be patient in order to learn about the rest. All in good time; all in good time. For now, though, hang right on to my cloak and jump when I jump and I will show you what the white wolves do when they are playing!”

Jay hung on as tightly as he could to the cloak, which was a kind of dark brown gray like the bark of the trees. That must be why it is so easy for Myrr to hide in the trees, thought Jay. Just as the wizard had told him, Jay jumped when the wizard jumped. Sparkles flew from his cloak and in no time his black cracked leather boots with the giant buckles, landed on the top branch of a very old pine

tree. Right next to them sat a Barred Owl that said, "Hoot Hoot!!" as they landed. He also fluffed his feathers out just a bit. “Don’t be frightened, oh beautiful owl. You look sort of like Feather, but I know you are not. We will not hurt you, I promise. You may know the wizard, anyway, so you know you will be safe with us."

The wizard looked at the owl and said, “Hello, Jay. It is so nice to see you.” HOOT, HOOT said the owl making his feathers sleek once again. “Are you watching the white wolves, too?” asked Myr. "HOOOOOT, HOOT!" said the owl blinking his eyes.

As Myr spoke to the owl, Jay looked down. There was Otter Pond gleaming in the sunlight under the blue sky. Sliding in a line on the smooth, clear ice were the white wolves. They were sliding in a line like skaters in the Ice Capades, all gliding together and letting out little hoots that were in harmony, that is their hoots make a pleasant musical sound when heard together.

“Do you hear how they are howling,” said Myr? "Wolves howl in harmony. They each have a different tone but they never howl in cacophony.”

“Ccccacophony?” asked Jay. “What does that mean?”

“It means without harmony”, said Myr. “They always howl like singers in harmony. Today I think they are singing a wonderful skating song by which to skate and maybe ice dance. “ Jay heard wonderful howls from the white wolves and they slid and danced on the pond. He started to clap his hands but the wizard warned him that he might scare them.

“Let’s go back down to the ground,” said Myr, sounding as though he were sad to leave. "It must be almost time for you to get back home before dark." Whoosh, went the wizard’s cloak as they left the tree and landed softly on the ground, the cloak sending sparklings as they dropped.

The wizard was right. It was getting a little dark. Jay hugged the wizard and started to run. As he turned around to wave, he saw the wizard give him a huge grin and snap his fingers together so that he could send out sparks into the cold air towards Jay. Jay ran with the sparks all around him. He felt as though they were keeping him warm. “Popsicles!” Jay whispered as he ran to the orphanage.
