#Chapter 21#
##Under the North Start##

At the castle spring had begun to appear in earnest. Crocuses had completely appeared, their colors popping out from under the thin blanket of snow that still lay on parts of the castle woods. They looked like brightly colored dresses with white petticoats showing below.

Jay had been coming to the castle for many weekends and it was wonderful. On this spring morning Jay was out walking in the woods of the castle. He did this almost every day that he visited. It was one of his most favorite things to do. Usually the dogs were with him but they had been helping Oscar to haul wood with a sled so that day they had stayed behind. Jay felt joy just scramble its way all through him. He loved the woods. He looked at the sky and all he could think of was a blueberry popsicle. When he did his mouth started to water—though it was still a bit cold for popsicles.

As the sun peeked out and then ducked behind a cloud, Jay began thinking, again, about all he still did not know about his past and about what his future would hold. All people have puzzles and secrets in their lives, he thought. Some puzzles never got figured out and some secrets never got told.

Jay looked up into the trees. He wondered if the wizard was there. He hadn’t seen him for quite some time. Suddenly, though, there he was, smiling and waving to Jay. Jay stood completely still. He was so excited. He hoped the wizard would hop down from the trees. Poof. There he was, black boots and all. He snapped his fingers in front of Jay and the sparks flew like sparks from a sparkler. Jay continued to stand very still. “Hhhhello Mr. Wizard, I mean Myrddin, he muttered. I am so glad to see you. I have missed you. Did you know I am staying at the castle every weekend now? It is such fun and I love Oscar and the animals. I hope they love me, too. I want to be adopted so I can REALLY be part of the castle. Well, I guess I am now but I would be ssso much more sure!”

The wizard winked at Jay and said, “I do know this and it is such a fine thing. Do not worry. You will be adopted very soon.”

“Hhhow do you know that?” said Jay “Do you just know everything?”

“No, not everything,” he replied. “But that one I know for sure.”

“Tttell me how, tell me how,” said Jay jumping up and down and looking a little pale.

“I am the only one to know that,” said Myrddin. “But know it I do.” And sparkles flew as he snapped his fingers and up into the tree he transported himself.

Jay just stared after him. He was too excited and scared to speak or move. I think that it is certain the wizard is going to help me to get adopted and

be at the castle forever. Magic can happen he whispered to himself. Oh how he wished he knew more about the wizard and why the wizard knew so much about Jay and his mother. As Jay stood wishing, a deer ambling along through the woods came into sight.

“Hello, Velvet,” Jay uttered with a voice filled with glee. “How are you? It has been a little while since I have seen you. Isn’t it the most beautiful of days!”

Velvet nodded his head and his antlers gleamed. He sidled over to Jay and nudged him. Jay couldn’t imagine what he wanted but he patted and rubbed his head. “My, whatever can you want?” asked Jay. The deer nudged him again and then bent one leg down so that his body was closer to the ground.

“Do you want me to get on your back? That would be such fun! Here I can try and see what you do.”

Up went Jay, scrambling to get his whole body onto the deer’s back and then balance himself. He hung onto Velvet’s neck, which was a little difficult because it was so large. Velvet started off a very slow pace. Once he knew that Jay was on tight, he sped up just a little.

“This is just ssssuper,” said Jay, struggling not to laugh right out loud. He just couldn’t help it, though, and he just opened his mouth wide and laughed and laughed out of simple joy.

.

Velvet said nothing. He just kept walking along. The woods were quiet and seemed gentle to Jay. “I wish I could be adopted and live at the castle all the time.” Velvet nodded his large head.

“Are you trying to talk with me, Velvet?” Jay asked with delight. Velvet nodded his head once again. Just then the largest beautiful orange butterfly that Jay had ever seen swooped down and landed on Velvet’s antlers.

“Hello to you, beautiful butterfly," said Jay. " What are you doing out here in the chill of spring?" Jay went on. The butterfly just fluttered his wings and landed on Jay’s red hair. “You must be part of the awesome magic of the castle woods,” Jay exclaimed as the butterfly fluttered out of sight.

“Well, Velvet, I hope you are saying that I will be adopted and live at the castle. I am not sure what you mean.” Velvet nodded yet again.

As Velvet rode on the two dogs from the cottage next door arrived in the woods near them. They were the dogs that had shown up at the Christmas outing by the sea. “Hello kind and spirited dogs," Jay said. "Are you here enjoying the day, too?" They just kept running and bouncing along beside them.

Velvet bent his knee and sat very still. Jay sort of lifted and threw himself off the large back. “I guess you knew that I wanted to pat the dogs,” said Jay. “How smart you are.” The dogs ran over to him and Jay patted them both, the large white one and the one that had all different brown spots on him and ice blue eyes.

“I hope I can be adopted and live at the castle,” Jay said to the dogs as he patted them. “Then you could come and visit and I would always be there to pat you! I wish I wish. Maybe I would still not know everything about my past but I would have a wonderful future. Sometimes I think I am not good enough to have good things happen, but I read that it is important to believe in yourself and trust that you will be cared for. Then you will come to understand kindness and it will be all around you and good luck will come your way. I am going to try that," he said to the dogs. "Do you agree?” The dogs sat down and stared at him. Then they both barked and wagged their tails.

“I need to get back to the castle," Jay said to the puppies who were also under the popsicle blue skies. “I hope I hope I will see you again soon—maybe at the castle. I am going to say over and over that I like myself and care about myself and trust that I will be kind and others will be kind to me. I will say that all the way home. I think Myrddin would approve. I know that he cares for me and so do Oscar and the dogs and now the new dogs. I care for me and I am kind and trusting,” he shouted up to the sky.

Then the castle came into view. Oscar was at the window in the kitchen, the dogs were lying outside by the door and he could see the cats all snuggled together on Beloved Feather’s stained glass windowsill. Amelia Bright had her big white paw on Sky’s back. Jay glanced up into the trees as he always did and a shower of colored sparks flew out as though a part of a rainbow had fallen from the sky. Jay heard a squeaky voice filtering through the rainbow sparks that said, “You must continue to follow your heart!” Jay smiled and waved at the trees. Then he snapped his fingers and to his surprise a tiny shower of sparks flew out. “I will follow my heart and be who I am,” he said with a smile to the trees as he looked up at his home.
