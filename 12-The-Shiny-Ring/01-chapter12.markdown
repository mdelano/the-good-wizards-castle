##The Shiny Ring on Christmas Day##

Christmas day finally arrived. All felt as though the night had been a thousand hours long. The sun was shining against the bright white snow. Oscar and Jay came downstairs very early. Jay ran and peeked under the beautiful tree. He was so excited he had hardly slept at all. This morning, very early, he had been awakened by the sound of bells. Was it a dream he wondered?

“Turn on the tree lights," Oscar called from the kitchen. The tree was so beautiful and so big that Jay just wanted to stare and stare. There were many presents under it. He felt in his bathrobe pocket to make sure the present he had made for Oscar was still there. “Phew,” her murmured when his hand found it.

The dogs were running about the house and the cats were all in the kitchen waiting for breakfast. Amelia had already tried to tear the paper from two packages. Beloved Feather looked as though he was getting stronger and stronger as he sat on his window watching everything inside and out.

Oscar remembered that he needed to get the turkey in the oven. It was a large turkey to feed so many people. Oscar and Jay were already dressed and ready to open presents and have breakfast so they could prepare for all the visitors who would come from the orphanage. Oscar fed the hungry cats and then fed the dogs and put them outside. They still had on their red and green ribbons and looked festive against the white snow.

Oscar asked Jay if he wanted to open his presents. “Oh yyyyes. I am so excited. I llove the tree and I have never gotten many presents before this. It is so nice to have a Christmas in a home, especially if it is the castle. But before I open anything, I have a present for you! Hhhhere it is.” Jay took a box all wrapped in paper that had been colored red and green and had pine boughs pasted on the top. " I made it for you. I hope you like it a lot.”

Oscar was clearly surprised and looked as though he was going to cry— not something Oscar did very often.

“Oh my, oh my," said Oscar spouting out two of the words he said most often. “Oh my, oh my. This is such a really good thing to have happen to me. A present for me on Christmas from someone I care about. I know I will love it.”

Oscar tore the pines and paper off with his large hands. There in his hands was a book that was written by Jay about his adventures in the woods at Otter Pond and at the castle. It had pictures that he had drawn and colored to go with the story. He had used heavy paper and poster paints . Oscar thought the pictures were so beautiful. He read a little of the book and then he did cry for just

an instant. He hugged Jay and said, “Oh, thank you. Oh thank you. This might be my best Christmas ever. “

Jay felt as happy as happy could be. Now he understood what the phrase: “it is better to give then to receive” really meant.

The dogs barked at the door and Jay ran to let them in. Oscar gave them their Christmas bones to chew on and two new toys for them to use to play tug of war. Off they scampered down the long castle hallway.

Then it was Jay’s turn. There were just so many presents! He was shaking just a little. He felt so lucky. He opened all the presents that Oscar handed him and loved every one. He couldn’t get over the train set and he couldn’t wait to read the books.

“I keep telling myself to believe," said Jay, "and look what is happening. Many wwonderful things. Sometimes you just have to wait. I wwwonder if this has to do with the wizard. I bet you he is watching all of us now. Do you think so Oscar?” Jay glanced at the leaded glass window as the firelight flickered on it. He looked out further to see the trees. Then he saw a red hat peak around the tree and then a boney hand held up in a wave. Before Oscar could even turn around it was gone.

Oscar was almost ready to hand Jay what he thought was the last present when he noticed that there were two more in the corner. “Maybe the dogs found these outside and brought them in,” Oscar said in a surprised kind of voice. One was lying on a piece of paper. It was a large white feather!

“Ddddo you think that is from Beloved Feather? “ he asked Oscar. “I don’t know said Oscar. This is a real mystery.” Then Snowy looked at Merlin and Snowy and the dogs began to wag their tails and yelp. Oscar looked at Jay. “Some things in life just stay mysteries for a very long time, maybe forever.”

“I hope not all of them,” said Jay thinking of what the wizard had said to him.

The second present was in a small box. When Jay opened it he saw a beautiful gold ring with an insignia of wolves, just like the one in the castle window above the door, carved in the flat top.

“Oh my, oh my,” said Oscar. "That is the same picture of the wolves as the one over the front entrance. Who could have given this to you? It is so beautiful. Does it fit?”

“I don’t know,” said Jay, touching it over and over. "It is just so beautiful. It reminds me of the story of the white wolves. Look how it shines! Do you think it can really be mine? It jjjust can’t be, can it?”

“Slip it on,” said Oscar. It was much too big for his finger.

“It is meant to be big enough for you to wear when you are older. I am sure of it. We will find a special box for you to keep it in until it fits you.”

Jay just held onto the ring so tightly that it started to feel warm.

Christmas Day had started out happily and mysteriously!
