#Chapter 16#
##Jay's Plans##

Jay was getting ready for bed. He had been thinking about the wolves dancing on the ice and how beautiful it was. Then he thought how much he liked the wizard and how much he hoped he would see him soon. Finally he thought about how much he missed the castle and everyone in it.

Jay had said his prayers and was tucked in for sleep but he just couldn’t stop thinking about the castle. The rest of the orphanage sounded as quiet as quiet as could be. The streetlight and the moonlight were casting shadows on his wall. Sleep just wouldn’t come.

Finally, Jay decided what he needed to do. Why try to sleep. It was time for him to take some action and hope it would help to get him back to the castle for longer times. Maybe he could even be adopted the way he dreamed! He needed to write Oscar a letter. He tiptoed out of bed to find his flashlight.

Once he had found his flashlight and a piece of paper and a crayon (he couldn’t seem to find a pencil or a pen) he tiptoed back into bed and made a tent with his sheets and blankets. Then after he had placed a book under the paper to make it firm, he thought and thought about what he should say to Oscar. What was there to say except how much he missed him and the castle? He thought and thought and rubbed his head and rubbed his eyes and still nothing seemed to end up on the paper. He wished he could look out the window and suddenly Feather would appear but he knew that he was back in the woods with his owls for the night. He could hear one of the children in the orphanage who had a cold start coughing and he could hear the nuns getting ready for sleep. Still nothing came out of his head and onto the paper.

After a while Jay fell asleep with the flashlight in one hand and the crayon in the other. When he awoke up he was confused. Why was he holding a flashlight? Then he remembered what he was trying to do. Suddenly he knew just what to say and lickity split he wrote it on the paper in the thick letters that you make with a crayon. He signed the note, Love, Jay. He didn’t know where he was going to get an envelope but he thought maybe at school someone would give him one and help him to mail the letter.

Jay got up again, ever so quietly, and placed the letter in his backpack. Then he slipped back into bed and immediately fell into a deep sleep. In his dreams he was, once again, flying through the sky. He was flying much higher than he had in the past. This time he were right up in the sky with the stars and the moon. He could see over the treetops and the sleigh bells were ringing and ringing. He was looking up at the sky and saying, “popsicle, popsicle." It was a wonderful dream.

The next morning Jay awoke feeling much better. Taking action can sometimes help a lot. He headed off to school to complete his plan. At

school Jay found an older student at school who helped him to mail his special letter. He knew he would if he tried hard enough. His eyes were as bright as stars for the rest of the day. He could hardly concentrate on his work. He just knew that Oscar would understand his letter and that things would be all right. Jay remembered that Oscar had told him that he should always believe, not just at Christmas time. So he said several times during the school day Jay said, “I believe. I believe. I believe. Good things will happen.”

That night he felt so much better for having done the best that he could to make things better. He went to sleep right away. He dreamt that Feather had flown to see him and that he was sitting outside his window. He did not wake up all night. If he had he would have seen Feather sitting outside his window making sure Jay was sleeping well and having fine dreams. Feather, of course, didn't know that he was in Jay's dreams!
