#Chapter 14#
##Freedom for Feather##
###Sounds and Silence###

A short time after Christmas and New Years Day had come and gone, the sun shone brightly waking Oscar up. He squinted when he looked out the window. As he did first thing every morning, Oscar fed Feather and checked his wing. This morning, Oscar clapped his hands in delight.

“Well my beautiful feathered friend," he said, "it looks as though your wing is completely healed. That means you will now be able to be free and to join your other owl friends. They will be so happy to see you.” Feather blinked his eyes several times and Sky began to purr just as loudly as he could.

“Life is filled with comings and goings,” Oscar said to Sky. "I am so happy that Feather is healed and can fly to his home. He is such a wonderful owl. I hope he has grown to love us as much as we all love him. I am not only happy, but I am also sad. I will miss him so much and I know we will often wonder how he is doing."

“Dear Feather, will you swoop by sometimes and give us all one of your hoots so we will know you are near us and well? All the animals and I will miss you so much, especially your friend, Sky.”

Feather blinked his eyes and gave a small hoot hoot and then made what sounded like a clapping sound that seemed to come from his tongue. Sky rolled over and put his paws over his eyes. He seemed so sad.

Oscar hung his head; he knew he had to let Feather go so he put out his hand and Feather jumped onto it. Slowly, Oscar took him to the door and pulled the door open even more slowly. It creaked just a little. He stared at Feather. He so much didn’t want to have him leave the castle. There were tears in Oscar’s eyes. Even though he knew that Feather belonged in the woods, leading his magical owls, Oscar wished he would just stay in the castle forever for Oscar loved him heaping amounts. Sky was staring out the window and Oscar knew he felt the same way.

Feather blinked his eyes many times and then put his big beak against Oscar’s cheek. Oscar patted his friend, Feather and then walked over to the huge tree where the owls had sat and placed Feather on the limb and turned and walked slowly back inside the castle. BONG, BONG, BONG, Chime, Chime. All the clocks in the castle began to ring.

What Oscar couldn’t see was that high in the tree sat two huge, beautiful Barred Owls waiting to escort Feather home and make sure he was safe during his journey away from the castle. What Oscar also could not see was that in the trees far beyond the castle were six deer. Their mission was to watch that Feather and the other owls got safely home. Even some of the white wolves from high on the hill came down to check on Feather. They were all very pleased to see how well he was doing. And the wizard watched from high in the trees near the castle.

Once Feather had finished holding a short parliament with his owls, he flew off for home. “It feels good to be free and to fly in the wide open air,” he said to his owls. "I have missed you so. Ahh, I do feel wonderful.” A little clapping sound of happiness seemed to come out from his throat and then the sound of Feather snapping his beak shut as many a Barred Owl has done before. The owls began to blink their eyes and let out hoot after hoot. Those in the castle and near by all heard this and knew that Beloved Feather must be home.

Once back inside the castle, Oscar got breakfast for everyone. Only Sky didn’t seem to want anything to eat. Oscar let the dogs out and noticed the Feather had already left the tree. He sat down in his big chair and thought how happy and sad he was, both at the same time. As he sat there he realized that he was already missing the owl and missing the idea that during the day he would hear the hoot hoot. He also heard no purring from Sky and no happy yelps from the dogs. But maybe most of all, he didn’t hear Jay’s laughter which always brought him such joy. Now all he heard was silence.

After a short while he took the dogs out to the barn. He thought maybe he would feel better if he could do some work outside. Sometimes forgetting just isn’t that easy to do and so he continued to feel terribly sad, no matter how hard he worked. The wind blew and the sun kept going behind the clouds. It was just not a very good day! Being outside with Oscar didn’t make the dogs feel any better either. Inside Sky was curled up in a ball in the corner of the window, so lonely without his friend. Silver was preening and cleaning and Amelia was in the kitchen looking for scraps of food to try. She was within inches of prying the lid off the flour jar. Sad or happy, Amelia always found something to do. Still, except for the clanging of the cover of the flour jar, everything seemed very, very silent at the castle.
