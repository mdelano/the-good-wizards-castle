##Born To Be Friends - Shared Intuition##

One day shortly after Merlin’s arrival at the castle, Oscar awoke to the brightest of days. The sunlight was bouncing off the snow-covered grounds. Oscar loved nature. He thought of it as healing and a gift to us all.

Oscar also loved animals so he was especially happy to awake to joyful yelping. He jumped out of bed, put on his fuzziest bathrobe so he wouldn’t be cold in the castle (which was always cold for a short time in the morning) and headed downstairs. There at the bottom of the stairs, wagging his tail stood the puppy with Snowy beside him. “Good morning, Snowy,” said Oscar. “And good morning to you my friendly puppy,” he said patting Merlin on the head. The puppy wagged his tail even harder. Snowy looked at Oscar as though she understood that the puppy now had a name and so he must be staying. Then she gave a couple of happy yelps, too.

It was almost Christmas so Oscar had many things to do to decorate the castle and wrap some presents for those in the nearby village. Funny, he thought, Merlin is my first Christmas present this year and must be one of the very best gifts anyone could ever receive! Oscar was a very tall man he gave a long, joyful skip. “I am going to get ready quickly", Oscar said. "Snowy you should take Merlin to play outside and I will meet you there.” Out they went.

Once they were outside, Merlin said to Snowy, "Remember that I was telling you that I have intuition that was given to me by the wizard? That means that I often have the power to know things before they happen. My intuition is at work right now and I am quite sure that there is someone outside the castle who wants to knock on the door and come in and be a part of castle life.”

“You can know something like that? “ asked Snowy.

“Yes, some things I just know,” said Merlin.

“Really?” said Snowy, looking as though she was not sure, even though he was already her best friend.

“Let’s just wait and see," said Merlin, "but it is making me worried. Still, I am a puppy and have not had much time to practice understanding my intuition. I wonder if I am good at that? Oh, gosh. Sometimes it is so hard to learn things. It can take time and effort. We will work together and everyone at the castle will be helping you, especially me!” said Snowy. They ran off to play.

After Oscar bundled himself up against the cold he went outside with the cats and joined the dogs. It looked exceptionally beautiful outside with the sun shining on the snow covered pines. There was about a foot of snow on the ground. Oscar noticed the foghorn was not mournfully calling across the castle beach. The dogs still frolicked in the snow, while the cats stood waiting for Oscar to shovel them a path. He shoveled; the cats played in the path and the dogs

scampered and scampered everywhere. Yahoo! Snowy looked at Merlin and said, “Would you like me to show you around the castle grounds? Maybe that would help you to stop worrying about your intuition.”

“Oh, I would love that Snowy", said Merlin giving a series of yelps. "I don’t think I have told you but I was living in the woods with the white wolves before I came to the castle. I belonged to the wizard, Myrddin. He took me to the wolves so that I could learn from them. He wanted them to teach me and to protect me until I was ready to leave to come to the castle. For that reason I know the hills and the deep woods very well. The wolves taught me all about them. But I do not know about the castle lands. I can’t wait to see them!”

As they set off, Snowy had a big red bow on her collar in honor of the coming of Christmas and Oscar had put a green one on Merlin. Snowy and Merlin walked and walked about the castle grounds and woods until they came upon the rocky walls and scrub pines that bordered the sandy beach. The waves were high that day and the sun glistened off the white caps. Merlin immediately understood that he had an awesome new home. Still, despite the walk and his happiness at knowing he had a wonderful new home, his intuition was nagging at the back of his mind and the wonder of the day was disturbed by that nagging. What, oh what, was his intuition trying to tell him? Was there something that he needed to do?
